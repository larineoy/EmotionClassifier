# EmotionClassifier

### Overview
Welcome to the EmotionClassifier, created as part of the BWSI CogWork 2024 program. In this project, our group trained an AI model capable of identifying emotions in speech audio across eight categories: angry, calm, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised. The model determines both the gender and the emotion of the speaker.
